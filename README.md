# nef-learn

This project intends to provide easy interactive learning of NeoVM3 (Neo3 Blockchain Virtual Machine) and the Neo3 Execution Format (NEF). It is an extension of [nvm-learn](https://neoresearch.io/nvm-learn) tutorial (that focused on Neo2), that gives innovative insights on the differences from Neo2 to Neo3 stack machines, and the newest developed opcodes.

This is under construction (so as NeoVM3 project), but tutorial is intended to be officially released soon (including latest advances).
